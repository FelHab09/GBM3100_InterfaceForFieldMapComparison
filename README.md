# GBM3100_InterfaceForFieldMapComparison
Project done for the GBM3100 class (Winter 2022) at Polytechnique Montreal
The interface was made with Matlab's App Designer (Matlab R2022a) for graphical and quantitative comparison of field map generation methods (dual-echo and multi-echo).
All files are included except for zubal_EAO.nii.m (this file needs to be added in the ShimmingToolbox folder)
